                        <p>Dubai's Islamic traditions and heritage of culture are reflected in its traditional clothing. Men dress in a white headpiece called a Gutra and a white ankle-length robe called a Kandura or Dishdasha. They may wear a Bisht on important events. Women dress in the Hijab, Shyla, Gishwah, Kaftan, Jalabiya, and the Abaya, a loose-fitting black garment. These clothes highlight modesty and offer protection from the wind and sun of the desert. Many Emiratis proudly dress their traditional clothing as a representation of their culture and identity.</p>
